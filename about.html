                  <p>Before i applied for polytechnic i came across this course called Applied AI and Analytics. I realized that the course was pretty hard to enter. Since i worked very hard during ITE and attained a very good GPA i had an oppurtunity to apply for this course and with coding being my passion it felt like the right decesion.</p>

                  <h2 class="aboutme">Goal One</h2>
                  <p class="about">One of my primary objectives is to promote sustainability and minimize waste by actively engaging in the practice of reusing items that are still in good condition. This can be accomplished through two main avenues: donation and repurposing. By donating items that I no longer need but are still usable, I can contribute to the well-being of others and extend the lifespan of those objects. This act of giving allows someone else to benefit from what might have otherwise been discarded. Additionally, I aim to find creative ways to repurpose items, breathing new life into them for different purposes. Instead of automatically discarding something, I explore its potential for alternative uses. This approach not only reduces the amount of waste I produce but also encourages resourcefulness and creativity. By prioritizing reuse, I strive to make a positive impact on the environment and encourage a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>

                      <h2 class="aboutme">Goal Two</h2>
                      <p class="aboutme">In addition to my first goal of reusing and repurposing items, another important objective of mine is to actively reduce wastage, particularly when it comes to plastic bags at grocery stores. To achieve this, I make a conscious effort to bring my own reusable bags when I go shopping instead of relying on plastic bags provided by the stores. By doing so, I not only minimize the amount of single-use plastic waste generated but also contribute to the conservation of natural resources used in the production of these bags. Through this simple yet impactful action, I aim to raise awareness about the harmful effects of plastic pollution and encourage others to adopt similar practices. By actively choosing to forgo plastic bags, I am taking a small but significant step towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious lifestyle.Furthermore, I actively seek out grocery stores and markets that prioritize sustainable practices.</p>

                  <h2 class="aboutme">Goal Three</h2>
                  <p class="about2">Lastly, my ultimate objective is to make recycling an integral part of my lifestyle, encompassing a diverse range of recyclable materials such as plastic, batteries, wood, paper, and anything else that holds the potential for repurposing. I firmly believe that responsible waste management is crucial for preserving our environment. To achieve this goal, I consistently prioritize the sorting and proper disposal of these materials, ensuring they find their way to the appropriate recycling facilities.By actively engaging in recycling programs and initiatives, I actively contribute to the collective effort of reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Every plastic container, battery, or piece of wood that is recycled represents a victory in the ongoing battle against resource depletion and pollution. Moreover, recycling paper products not only conserves trees but also helps protect the delicate ecosystems they support.</p>
